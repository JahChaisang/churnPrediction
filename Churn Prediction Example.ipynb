    "\n",
    "In business world, one important measure is \"Churn Rate\", the rate at which customers terminate the service. For example, in telecommunication, customer churn is one of the most important business health metrics, so important they have customer churn agents whose job is to call customers who are likely to leave and offer them very special deals to tempt them to stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we look at a dataset from telecommunication industry. Each customer profile (row) has several variables as shown in the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last column (Churn?) is the output variable we are interested in. We want to look into all customers in our database and predict the likelihood of each customer leaving the business."
